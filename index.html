                who has been serving as Chief Adviser of the Interim Government of Bangladesh since 8 August 2024.[1]
                Yunus was awarded
                the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit
                and
                microfinance.[2] Yunus has received several other national and international honors, including the
                United States
                Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.[3] Yunus is one of only
